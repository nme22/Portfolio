                    <p>Welcome to the page! My name is Navid Ebrahimi and I'm a first generation Iranian American developer! My introduction into coding was recommended by a friend, Domitrius Clark. He believed that my ability and personal qualities would make a great web developer. As a first taste, Domitrius recommended intro's to HTMl through <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Freecodecamp.org</a>.
                    There I caught fire coding. Something that was vauge and unknown became interesting, challenging, and i kept finding myself wanting to practice it more and more! Before i knew it i had done over 300 hours of HTML challenges and an addtional 300 hours of CSS challenges. The excitement of learning new material and applying different visual effects gave a sense of pride in my work.
                    It was then that i knew i wanted to pursue a career in the tech industry. With aspirations of becoming a senior developer, i entered the Rutger's Bootcamp to further my coding journey. I'm aiming to become the right person for the job by becoming a full stack developer! Feel free to reach out to me via the contact options below!
